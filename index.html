    <h1>Show your focus by growing a garden!</h1>
    <h2>Focus Garden is a minimalist web app that turns your focus time into something you can see and grow.
        Each time you start a focus session, a seed begins to sprout. Stay on task, and it blossoms; get distracted, and growth pauses.
        Your garden becomes a visual record of your consistency and discipline.</h2>
